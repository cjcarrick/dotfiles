# It seems like: 
# - defaults.pcm.card sets the card to ouput to
# - defaults.ctl.card sets the card that gets controlled by `alsamixer`. 
# - defaults.pcm.device sets the device on the card to output through
#   - Ex: Nvidia card, outputting to the 2nd HDMI port
#
# Use
# - `aplay -Ll` to list cards and devices
# - `alsamixer` to unmute channels and set volume
# - `speaker-test` to test output
