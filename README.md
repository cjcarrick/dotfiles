# My dotfiles

_Files for mac and linux exist in the mac and linux branches_

# Notes

Some configuration files are Linux or MacOS specific.

A lot of the programs I use (on Linux and Mac) are listed in
[linux-from-scratch.md](linux-from-scratch.md).

## ZSH

There is no plugin manager. Install these manually:

- [zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)
- [jeffreytse/zsh-vi-mode](https://github.com/jeffreytse/zsh-vi-mode)

## Neovim

Configuration is based on the latest nightly build of neovim.

Filetype icons are based on the
font (fantasque-sans-mono) at the root of this repo includes the icons from
[seti](https://github.com/jesseweed/seti-ui/tree/master/styles/_fonts/seti),
which are only one character wide. There are a lot more icons in
this seti than in normal Nerd Font patched font.
